cloudBox World Format - by tyteen4a03 with input from fragmer
Official documentation maintained here and on http://wiki.vg/ClassicWorld_file_format

File Extension: .cw (Classic World. We are so creative!)
File Format: gzip'd NBT:

ClassicWorld: Compound[
    FormatVersion: Byte() // Version of level file.
    Name: String()
    // Random bytes. This must stay intact in between loading/saving worlds.
    // In Python uuid.uuid4() can be used.
    UUID: ByteArray()
    // Coordinates are all shorts, ranging from 0 to 2047. At runtime 1 is added to support maximum 2048^3 map size.
    X: Short() // Length of level.
    Y: Short() // Width of level.
    Z: Short() // Height of level.
    CreatedBy: Compound[ // The creator of this map. Optional.
        Service: String() // Minecraft or ClassiCube.
        Username: String()
    ]
    MapGenerator: Compound[ // How this map was created. Optional.
        Software: String() // cloudBox, obviously
        MapGeneratorName: String()
    ]
    TimeCreated: Long() // Time of level creation. Unix timestamp. Optional.
    LastAccessed: Long() // Last time it was accessed. Optional.
    LastModified: Long() // Last time it was modified. Optional.
    Spawn: Compound[ // Spawn point.
        X: Short()
        Y: Short()
        Z: Short()
        H: Byte() // Heading
        P: Byte() // Pitch
    ]
    // Byte array of blocks. Index is calculated using this formula: (z * Length + y) * Width + x
    BlockArray: ByteArray()

    // Metadata of the world. Required, even if no metadata exist.
    Metadata: Compound[
        softwareName: Compound[
            pluginName: Compound[
                // Global metadata.
                Metadata: Compound[
                    // Plugins decide their own format here.
                ]
                // Block-specific metadata.
                BlockIndices: IntArray() // List of block indices, as ints
                BlockMetadata: List(Compound)[
                    // List of metadata corresponding to each block in BlockIndices
                    // Must have same order and length as BlockIndices
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
]

Notes:
1. Reserved Metadata softwareNames are: CPE (For CPE-extension-related format, see worldFormat-CPE)
2. Optional fields are not required for normal operation, but implementation of these fields is highly recommended.
3. Custom tags outside Metadata is allowed (for readability or flexibility), however please use non-standard-clashing
prefixes (i.e cpe_myShinyTag would be a bad idea).
4. If it is not clear to you (as you probably have Wikipedia'd the article), all Unix timestamps must be in UTC.
