Terminologies:
Disconnect the server/client - Send a Disconnect packet with the appropriate DisconnectType, then close the connection.
StateRepository - A dictionary holding a player's state (information).


0x00 - Keep Alive
Two-way
Used by: HubServer, WorldServer, DatabaseServer, WebServer
Direction: * <-> *

Both ways
Packet Data:
None

Handling of packet (both ways):
Indicates the opposite side is still "alive". If opposite side do not send a keep-alive after the timeout period
(? seconds is recommended), the server assumes that the opposite side has unexpectedly disconnected, and performs
relevant cleanups.



0x01 - Handshake
Two-way
Used by: HubServer, WorldServer, DatabaseServer, WebServer
Direction: Client -> Server, Server -> Client

Client to Server
Packet Data:
ClientName: String - The client's name
ClientType: Int - The client's type. Must be an integer defined in cloudbox.common.constants.common.SERVER_TYPES

Server to Client
Packet Data:
ServerName: String - The server's name
ServerType: Int - The server's type. Must be an integer defined in cloudbox.common.constants.common.SERVER_TYPES

Handling of packet (Server to Client):
When a client connects, server must immediately check if the client is within its accepted client range. If the client
is not in the whitelist, disconnect with a Disconnect packet. Server should then expect a Handshake packet. If the
client sends anything other than the Handshake packet, disconnect the client.
Upon receiving the packet, perform other necessary checks, If conditions are not met, disconnect the client.
If there are no problems, register the client and send a Handshake packet indicating an establishment of the
connection. Server can then starting data to the client.

Handling of packet (Client to Server):
When connection is made, client must send a Handshake packet, and wait for either a Disconnect packet, or a Handshake
packet indicating successful handshaking.



0x04 - State ID Allocation
Two-way
Used by: HubServer, WorldServer
Direction: * <-> *

Both ways
Packet Data:
RequestID: A random integer.
ClientID: A State ID. Integer.

Handling of packet (Server to Client):
StateRepository ID Control resides at the Server. If the Server wishes to add a new entry, it must generate a random
integer as the RequestID, and send it to the Client. The Client must respond with the same packet, indicating the
entry has been successfully added.

If the Client wishes to add a new entry, it must generate a random integer as the Request ID, and set the ClientID
to 0. The server then must respond with the same RequestID and the newly allocated ClientID.


0x05 - State Update
Two-way
Used by: HubServer, WorldServer
Direction: * <-> *

Both ways
Packet Data:
ClientID: The client's ID the sender wishes to update. Must be an integer.
ClientState: A dictionary of any state the sender wishes to update.

Handling of packet (Both Ways):
Both sides are expected to overwrite values according to the client.


0x06 -
